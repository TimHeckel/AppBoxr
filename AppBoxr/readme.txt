Thanks for installing AppBoxr, a micro framework for .NET. I hope you like it.

The easiest way to get started with AppBoxr is to modify the index.html file located
in the /AppBoxr/index.html directory to your local URL (using whatever web server 
you've got configured for your local development (IIS / IIS Express / Cassini, etc).

This is line you need to change:

	url: "http://localhost:1975"
